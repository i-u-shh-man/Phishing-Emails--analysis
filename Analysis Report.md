# Phishing Email - Analysis Report

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 

### I. Executive Summary-



The email titled "URGENT: Your Corporate Access Will Be Revoked in 24 Hours!" is a classic, high-risk phishing attempt. Its primary goal is to steal corporate credentials and/or deliver malware by leveraging classic social engineering tactics like fear and urgency, combined with technical deception.





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### II. Detailed Analysis of Red Flags-



The following points detail the specific suspicious elements found in the email and how they reveal the malicious intent.



1\. Urgency and Threatening Tone



Suspicious Element: The subject line and body contain extreme threats like "URGENT," "Will Be Revoked in 24 Hours!," and "FAILURE TO ACT WITHIN 24 HOURS WILL RESULT IN THE PERMANENT SUSPENSION..."



Tactic: Social Engineering (Fear/Pressure). This tactic aims to create panic, forcing the recipient to click the link without taking time for critical assessment. Legitimate security teams typically do not issue such immediate, non-negotiable threats via an unverified initial email.



2\. Typographical and Grammatical Errors



Suspicious Element: The email is riddled with errors, including Empolyee, unuaual, saftey, privilages, and incorrect grammar such as, "Its important that you're corporate accounts is secure."



Tactic: Unprofessionalism. A legitimate corporate IT department would thoroughly proofread high-stakes security notices. The sheer number of errors is a major red flag.



3\. Suspicious Sender and Generic Greeting



Suspicious Element: The greeting is "Dear Valued Empolyee" and the sender is listed as security\_alerts@cormany-corp.net.



Tactic: Lack of Personalization \& Domain Spoofing. Official security warnings are nearly always addressed to the recipient by name. Furthermore, the sender domain (cormany-corp.net) does not match the company's presumed domain (company-corp.com), using a confusingly similar domain to deceive the user.



4\. Malicious Link for Credential Harvesting



Suspicious Element: The call-to-action link is titled "Verify Account Security Now!!!", but the actual destination URL is https://www.company-corp.security-portal.login.ru/verify.



Tactic: Credential Harvesting. The URL reveals the attempt. By hovering over the link, you can see the actual destination uses the highly suspicious .ru (Russian Federation) Top-Level Domain, clearly indicating an external, hostile site designed only to steal login credentials.



5\. Dangerous Attachment for Malware Delivery



Suspicious Element: The email includes an attachment titled Urgent\_Security\_Patch.exe.



Tactic: Malware Delivery. The .exe extension signifies an executable file (a program). Corporate security patches are virtually never distributed as unsolicited email attachments due to the extreme security risk. This file is intended to install malware.

### III. Recommended Security Action-



Any user receiving this email must take the following steps immediately:



Do Not Click: Avoid clicking on the link or attempting to download or open the attached file (.exe).



Report Immediately: Forward the full email to your organization's verified IT Security or Help Desk email address.



Use a Trusted Channel: If you are unsure about the status of your account, contact IT directly via a known, trusted method (e.g., phone call or official internal web portal) rather than using any information provided in the suspicious email.



Delete: Permanently delete the email from your inbox and deleted items folder.
