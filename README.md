## Phishing Email Analysis Project:
---

## This repository documents the analysis of a real-world phishing email sample used for educational and security training purposes.

---

1. Project Goal-
   
The primary goal of this exercise was to practice identifying advanced social engineering and technical red flags within a suspicious email, generating a detailed security analysis, and documenting the process.

---

2. Step-by-Step Process-


-Below is a log of the actions taken to analyze and document this phishing attempt:

-Submission of Sample Email: The raw phishing email content (SAMPLE EMAIL - phishing attempt.md) was submitted for review.

-REVIEWED AND OBSERVED commonly noticeable mistakes and imperfections to detect threats.

-Initial Analysis Request: A request was made to perform a comprehensive analysis, identifying all suspicious elements and the detection methods used.

-Analysis Generation (Initial Draft): The initial analysis was created, highlighting key red flags (typos, urgency, malicious URL, and attachment).

-README Creation (Current Step): The final analysis report and the original sample were consolidated into this README.md file along with the process log.

        PS:- (FIRST I USED ONLINE SEARCH RESULTS AND TOOK HELP OF AI TO CREATE MY OWN SAMPLE OF THE PHISHING EMAIL INSTEAD OF USING ONE THAT I FOUND ORGANICALLY)
